# Cursory Backend

## What is Cursory?

Cursory is a personal web application designed to organize and structure technical knowledge into well-defined courses and learning roadmaps. It focuses on topics such as robotics, MATLAB, embedded systems, programming, software, and artificial intelligence â€” allowing for the structured documentation of mastered subjects.

The core purpose of Cursory is to serve as a personal knowledge repository for quick reference, while also laying the foundation for future mentorship or guided learning opportunities.

## Objectives of Cursory

- Organize personal knowledge into thematic, structured courses.

- Enable quick and organized access to specific study notes or topics.

- Serve as a foundation for mentoring or academic guidance in the future.

- Define learning roadmaps that group courses toward deeper specialization.

- Design an extensible platform, capable of supporting additional entities later (e.g., projects, challenges, resources).

- Focus development on a personal-use version first, including an admin panel and backend. Leaving room for long-term expansion, possibly offering Cursory as a learning platform for UASLP students, with enrollment, progress tracking, and roadmap completion.
